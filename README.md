# Rice-hero | C23-PC627

Our project, Ricehero, is a project aimed to improve rice accessibility and rice agribusiness. We hoped to develop an application that can help rice farmers plan their rice farming more effectively and efficiently.

As the name suggests, we combine two words from English language, namely Rice and Hero, to capture the dictionary definition of "Rice with good qualities" inline with our goal to provide a platform for rice farmer to improve their crop management accordingly.
