# About the Android Project

This application implementing MVVM Architecture Pattern. By using the mvvm architecture pattern, it will separate the business logic (model), user interface (view), and 
viewmodel to make application development, maintenance, and testing easier. View will observe live data from viewmodel while the data that observed in view model 
is obtained from data source layer (model and repository). The data used in this application is static data and response data (API). Static data is used to display 
information about plant diseases and plant descriptions. while the response data from the API is used to display the prediction results of the plants that are detected.
