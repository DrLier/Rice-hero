# Machine Learning Codebase ðŸŒ¾

This folder stores the machine learning feature of our application. Listed below are the details about our folders.

- Rice Disease Classification ðŸ¦ 

  <p>In the rice disease classification folder, we store the dataset that we use to build the model, model building notebook, and the model py file. We modelled 4 classes of rice disease, namely : brownspot, blast, leaf blight, and tungro. We also modelled an additional 1 healthy class as the positive control. We use transfer learning method with InceptionV3 and we are able to reach ... validation accuracy and ... test accuracy based on the model.

- Rice Price Forecasting ðŸ’°
  <p>
  In the rice price forecasting folder, we store the dataset, model building notebook, and the model py file. In this model, we modelled the weekly rice price data from January 2020 until the recent date using LSTM. The final model had the RMSE of 117 and MAPE of 0.92% for data validation, and RMSE of 91 and MAPE of 0.69% for data testing, meaning in average the predicted price had Rp100 difference with the actual price. </p>
